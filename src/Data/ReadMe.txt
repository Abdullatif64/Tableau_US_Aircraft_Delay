The data were gathered from:
1. http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html
2. http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/supplemental-data.html
3.https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?Table_ID=236
as three csv files. The data was joint as follows: 2008_delay and airports were left joint on Origin and Iata respectively, 
2008_delay and carriers were left joint on Unique and Iata code.  
The data was cleaned lightly by adding a date column with type datetime. Also, changing the Cancellation codes to more meaningful names.
More information about the data can be found on the websites
